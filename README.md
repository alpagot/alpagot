- 👋 Hi, I’m @alpagot
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Fastly, F1, Tennis as well as fun things to do for the family! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning doing a Prince2 course with my learning fund. 
- 💞️ No collaborations at the mo but open to a blog post, I have a few projects going as well! 
- 📫 How to reach me: A DM to @alpagot on Twitter or via linkedIn is probably best initially if we're not aquainted.
